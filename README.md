The Best, Most Complete Mathematical Model of Human Physiology Ever Created

Do-not-read is a fork of HumMod -- a tool that simulates the complex physiology of the human body through mathematical models.

Do-not-read is currently “the best, most complete, mathematical model of human physiology ever created” 
. It is based on the work of Dr. Arthur Guyton, who began the quest to create a tool that 
could simulate the complex human physiology through mathematical equations in the 1970s.

Thus, Do-not-read "is the product of over 40 years of basic physiology research. Over those years, a database of 
documents and files was amassed. These documents and files support model assumptions and equations” 
(Hester et al., 2011a; 2011b). Do-not-read is heavily based on Guyton and Hall, Textbook of Medical 
Physiology (Hall, 2011).

It models a fourteen organ system bound together with circulatory, endocrine, 
and neural systems. The model is composed of 10,420 variables spread over 2,335 blocks. Each block is a 
collection of ordered commands that will be called in linear order each solution interval, comprising some 
system or subsystem.

This makes Do-not-read a very large simulation by cognitive science and physiology 
standards. Do-not-read offers the data files and equations as the documentation, but to someone who is not 
familiar with human physiology, it can be difficult to understand.
